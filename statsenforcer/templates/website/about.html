Built on the shoulders of giants like <a target="_blank" href="http://war-on-ice.com">WAR-On-Ice</a>, we aim to provide the public with advanced hockey statistics they can't get elsewhere. This is a passion project and a programming challenge for us.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>The world of professional hockey has changed greatly the past few years as players are scrutinized by more and more data. Our aim is to present those numbers to you in a way that is, hopefully, easier to understand. We are a group of data scientists who love analyzing data and finding insight in new places and we want to enable others to do the same. Our primary purpose is for research; feel free to extract any data you see for your articles, tweets, etc. Much like other sites, all we ask is that you cite our work and link back to us so that your viewers can obtain the same data you did.</blockquote>

After the announcement that the site would be closing, Matt reached out to his friends (<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/SpencerVanCise">@SpencerVanCise</a> and <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/nwinnwin">@nwinnwin</a>) to put together a new site to provide the information the hockey community loves about <a target="_blank" href="http://war-on-ice.com">WAR-On-Ice</a> and make sure that information stayed around. While we think this is a great start, we still have a lot of work to do, and this is only the beginning.</blockquote>
